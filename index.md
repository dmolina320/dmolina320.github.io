### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    Lab 1 was my favorite because that is where we were all starting to learn how to code and how to read the code and edit it. We did not know much but I was curious on how this experience can lead to somwhere else.

* Lab 5
    Lab 5, part 2 was my second favorite because I was always interested in blackjack and used to play it with m family. To be able to code blackjack was amazing and hard at the same time but I always love a good challenge.

* Lab 8
    Lab 8, part 1 was my third favorite because I started learning loops and it took me a while to get the right code. I love trying different ways to loop to be able to get the result. While it took a long time I liked the challenge.
